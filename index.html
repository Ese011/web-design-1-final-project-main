                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is [Insert Name] and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.
                <p>
                    Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained
                    experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator,
                    InDesign), Figma, and Sketch.</p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to
                    experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.
